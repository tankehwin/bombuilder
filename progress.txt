- created initial tables, created shells for ItemModel, ChainManager, FittingModel classes
- copied over some files from dynaflo project as base and examples
- building logic via table structure, choosing to do persistent chain objects stored in database, unique to individual users
- finished basic structure for all Model classes
- some ideas on how to regenerate the working chain from database filtered by login, using recursive function
- recursive function completed, redefined and built model classes (ChainModel, ConnectorItemLinkModel, ConnectorMatchModel, ConnectorModel, ItemModel)
- populated ChainManager and created ChainStructure
- realigned web assets to correct location
- created test function to see how ChainManager will regenerate chains and display them
